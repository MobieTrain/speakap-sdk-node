Speakap-SDK
===========

Libraries to aid 3rd-party Speakap Application developers.

Currently, we have libraries to aid developers for 3 different server-side languages and platforms,
as well as a library for aiding frontend developers to integrate their Application with Speakap.

Node
----------

We also have a server-side JavaScript library for usage with Node.js. Just copy `speakap.js` from
the `node` directory into your project and require it to get going. There is inline documentation in
the file itself.

There are usage examples for the Node.js library in the `examples/node` directory.
